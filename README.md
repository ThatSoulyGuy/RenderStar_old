This is a game engine. It runs on DirectX 12, using the common Win32 APIs. It uses Dxc to compile shaders. All shaders are compiled to Shader Model 6.6
#
# Why should I use this?
You should not use this game engine YET. It is incomplete for now, as I have yet to implement a stable renderer.
#
# Why should I care?
You shouldn't
#
# How does this benefit me?
It gives you a platform to make a game on
